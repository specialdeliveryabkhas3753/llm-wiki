# Spec: Schema — Page Types, Properties & Validation

## Description

The schema defines the structural contract for all wiki pages. Every page has a type,
every type has required properties with allowed values, and every page must follow
tool-specific formatting rules. The schema is enforced during ingest (creation) and
lint (validation).

---

## Requirements

### Page Types (Mutually Exclusive)

- REQ-500: Every wiki page MUST declare exactly one `type` property. Valid values:
  `entity`, `project`, `knowledge`, `feedback`, `hub`.
- REQ-501: A page MUST NOT have multiple types. The type is immutable after creation.
- REQ-502: A page with an unrecognized type value SHALL be flagged by lint as
  "unknown type".

### Entity Type

- REQ-510: Entity pages MUST have ALL of these properties:
  - `type` = `entity`
  - `entity-type` = one of: `person`, `client`, `tool`, `service`, `technology`
  - `created` = date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `updated` = date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `status` = one of: `active`, `inactive`, `archived`
  - `source` = one of: `memory-migration`, `ingest`, `manual`
- REQ-511: An `entity-type` value not in the allowed list SHALL be flagged by lint.
- REQ-512: A `status` value not in the allowed list SHALL be flagged by lint.
- REQ-513: When an entity represents both a person and a client, `entity-type`
  SHALL be set to the primary role (`person` if individual, `client` if business
  relationship is primary).

### Project Type

- REQ-520: Project pages MUST have ALL of these properties:
  - `type` = `project`
  - `status` = one of: `active`, `completed`, `on-hold`, `cancelled`
  - `created` = date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `updated` = date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `started` = date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- REQ-521: Project pages MAY have an optional `completed` date property.
- REQ-522: If `status` is `completed`, the page SHOULD have a `completed` date.
  Lint MAY flag a completed project without a `completed` date as info-level.

### Knowledge Type

- REQ-530: Knowledge pages MUST have ALL of these properties:
  - `type` = `knowledge`
  - `domain` = one of: `tech`, `business`, `content`, `ops`
  - `created` = date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `updated` = date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `confidence` = one of: `high`, `medium`, `low`, `stale`
- REQ-531: A `domain` value not in the allowed list SHALL be flagged by lint.
- REQ-532: When knowledge spans multiple domains, `domain` SHALL be set to the
  primary domain. There is no multi-domain value.
- REQ-533: The `confidence` property follows this lifecycle:
  - `high` → verified, reliable, up-to-date
  - `medium` → probably correct, verify on next ingest
  - `low` → uncertain, incomplete, or limited sources
  - `stale` → was high/medium but `updated` is 90+ days old

### Feedback Type

- REQ-540: Feedback pages MUST have ALL of these properties:
  - `type` = `feedback`
  - `severity` = one of: `critical`, `important`, `nice-to-know`
  - `created` = date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `verified` = date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `applies-to` = one or more page references
- REQ-541: `severity` determines L1 candidacy:
  - `critical` → almost always belongs in L1 Memory
  - `important` → sometimes belongs in L1 Memory
  - `nice-to-know` → rarely belongs in L1 Memory
- REQ-542: `verified` tracks the last date this feedback was confirmed still valid.
  It is distinct from `updated` (content change) — a page can be verified without
  changing content.

### Hub Type

- REQ-550: Hub pages MUST have ALL of these properties:
  - `type` = `hub`
  - `namespace` = the namespace path (e.g., `Wiki/Tech`)
- REQ-551: Hub pages are structural (navigation), not knowledge-bearing. They
  list child pages in their namespace.
- REQ-552: Hub pages are exempt from orphan detection (they are entry points).
- REQ-553: Hub pages MUST still have at least 1 outgoing `[[Wiki/...]]` link
  (typically links to their child pages).
- REQ-554: Every namespace MUST have exactly one hub page.

### Date Validation

- REQ-560: All date properties MUST use ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- REQ-561: Dates MUST be zero-padded: `2026-04-01`, not `2026-4-1`.
- REQ-562: Dates with slashes (`2026/04/01`), dots (`2026.04.01`), or other
  separators SHALL be flagged as invalid.
- REQ-563: The system SHOULD validate that dates are real calendar dates
  (e.g., `2026-02-30` is invalid).

### Cross-Reference Rules

- REQ-570: Every non-hub page MUST have at least 1 outgoing `[[Wiki/...]]` link.
- REQ-571: Hub pages MUST list ALL child pages that exist in their namespace.
- REQ-572: When a page mentions an entity that has its own wiki page, it SHOULD
  use `[[Wiki/...]]` link syntax instead of plain text.
- REQ-573: Every non-hub page SHOULD end with a `## Cross-References` section
  (Obsidian) or `- ## Cross-References` section (Logseq) listing key outgoing links.
- REQ-574: Link syntax is `[[Wiki/Namespace/Page]]` in both Logseq and Obsidian.
  Backlinks are automatic in both tools.

### Namespace Conventions

- REQ-580: Namespace names MUST use Title Case: `Wiki/Tech`, not `Wiki/tech`.
- REQ-581: Multi-word names MUST use hyphens: `Wiki/Projects/Blog-Series`,
  not `Wiki/Projects/Blog_Series` or `Wiki/Projects/Blog Series`.
- REQ-582: Namespace depth MUST NOT exceed 3 levels. `Wiki/Business/Clients/Acme`
  (3 levels) is the maximum. A 4th level is not allowed.
- REQ-583: File names MUST follow tool conventions:
  - Logseq: `Wiki___Namespace___Page.md` (triple-underscore, flat directory)
  - Obsidian: `Wiki/Namespace/Page.md` (directory hierarchy)

### Tool-Specific Format Rules

- REQ-590: In Logseq mode, every line of wiki content MUST start with `- `
  (outliner block prefix). No exceptions.
- REQ-591: In Logseq mode, properties MUST use inline syntax: `property:: value`.
  YAML frontmatter is NOT allowed.
- REQ-592: In Obsidian mode, properties MUST be in YAML frontmatter
  (between `---` fences at the top of the file).
- REQ-593: In Obsidian mode, content uses standard markdown. The `- ` block
  prefix is NOT required.
- REQ-594: In Logseq mode, headings go inside blocks: `- ## Section Name`.
  In Obsidian mode, headings use standard markdown: `## Section Name`.
- REQ-595: Mixing tool formats (e.g., Logseq outliner syntax in an Obsidian wiki)
  SHALL be flagged by lint.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Valid entity page — all properties correct

```
GIVEN the configured tool is logseq
WHEN a page is created with:
    - type:: entity
    - entity-type:: technology
    - created:: 2026-04-10
    - updated:: 2026-04-10
    - status:: active
    - source:: ingest
AND the page has content blocks and at least 1 [[Wiki/...]] link
THEN lint SHALL report no issues for this page
```

### Scenario 2: Missing required property

```
GIVEN an entity page Wiki/Tech/Redis exists with:
    - type:: entity
    - entity-type:: technology
    - created:: 2026-04-10
    (missing: updated, status, source)
WHEN lint runs
THEN the system SHALL flag 3 missing properties: updated, status, source
AND report severity: warning
```

### Scenario 3: Invalid entity-type value

```
GIVEN a page has entity-type:: framework
WHEN lint runs
THEN the system SHALL flag: "Invalid entity-type 'framework'.
    Allowed: person, client, tool, service, technology"
```

### Scenario 4: Invalid date format

```
GIVEN a page has created:: 2026-4-1
WHEN lint runs
THEN the system SHALL flag: "Invalid date format '2026-4-1'.
    Required: YYYY-MM-DD (zero-padded)"
```

### Scenario 5: Logseq syntax in Obsidian wiki

```
GIVEN the configured tool is obsidian
AND a page starts with "- type:: knowledge" (Logseq outliner syntax)
    instead of YAML frontmatter
WHEN lint runs
THEN the system SHALL flag: "Page uses Logseq outliner format but wiki
    is configured for Obsidian. Properties should be in YAML frontmatter."
```

### Scenario 6: Namespace depth exceeded

```
GIVEN someone attempts to create Wiki/Business/Clients/Acme/Contact
    (4 levels deep)
WHEN the system validates the namespace
THEN it SHALL reject the page: "Namespace depth 4 exceeds maximum of 3.
    Add 'Contact' as a section within Wiki/Business/Clients/Acme instead."
```

### Scenario 7: Hub page missing namespace property

```
GIVEN a page has type:: hub but no namespace:: property
WHEN lint runs
THEN the system SHALL flag: "Hub page missing required property: namespace"
```

### Scenario 8: Completed project without completed date

```
GIVEN a project page has status:: completed but no completed:: property
WHEN lint runs
THEN the system SHALL flag at info level: "Project is completed but has
    no completed:: date. Consider adding one."
AND this SHALL NOT be treated as a warning or error
```

### Scenario 9: Cross-reference section missing

```
GIVEN a knowledge page has 2 outgoing [[Wiki/...]] links in the body
BUT does not have a ## Cross-References section at the end
WHEN lint runs
THEN the system SHOULD flag at info level: "Page has no Cross-References
    section. Consider adding one for clarity."
AND this SHALL NOT be treated as a warning (outgoing links exist)
```

### Scenario 10: Multi-domain knowledge — primary domain chosen

```
GIVEN a page covers both Strapi configuration (tech) and content publishing (content)
WHEN the user creates the page during ingest
THEN domain:: SHALL be set to the PRIMARY domain (e.g., tech if the page
    is mostly about Strapi configuration)
AND the system SHALL NOT create two pages or use a multi-domain value
```

---

## Dependencies

- specs/lint.md rules 1-9 enforce these schema constraints
